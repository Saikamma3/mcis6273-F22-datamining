    "\n",
    "- The one thing I learnt via this podcast is the vast applications of data science in almost every filed. Adam's work on cognitive psychology is attention seeker in my opinion. Art of making a program that will make the simulation of a brain thinking found attractive to me\n",

I feel jupyter has made it so easy to understand others codes, get learnings from them and utilise them for our respective purposes. Getting to know that most of the work is being done in python language was satisfying. "

This github world has so many hidden gems and I feel data mining learnings will help us to find such gems and get knowledge from these notebooks. The jupyter notebook provides a facility of cell by cell exection, which makes life easy for debugging the code. Exited !"
